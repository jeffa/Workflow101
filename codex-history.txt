v0.0
    I’ve added a new “release notes” action that will run on every push to main, scan your commit messages for the tags added:, updated:, and deleted:, and automatically append the matching
    entries into a single RELEASE_NOTES.md document.

    What was added:

    • scripts/update_release_notes.sh – a small bash script that
      – bootstraps RELEASE_NOTES.md (if it doesn’t exist) with “Unreleased” sections
      – parses the commit range for any “tag: description” lines
      – injects each matching line under the correct ### Added / ### Updated / ### Deleted header

    • .github/workflows/release-notes.yml – a GitHub Actions workflow triggered on push to main that
      – checks out the full history (fetch-depth: 0)
      – runs the above script with the before/after SHAs
      – commits & pushes the updated RELEASE_NOTES.md back to the repo (using the Actions token)

    • RELEASE_NOTES.md – initial headings for “Unreleased” changes
v0.1
    I’ve added a new Release Notes section to the README, detailing:

        * The `.github/workflows/release-notes.yml` workflow (trigger, permissions, and step-by-step behavior).
        * The `scripts/update_release_notes.sh` script (initialization, log parsing, entry insertion).
        * How to use the workflow via commit-message conventions.
